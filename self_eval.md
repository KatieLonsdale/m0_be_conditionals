# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

I feel confident in my understanding of them. They made sense to me pretty quickly because they remind me of math.

2. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

I feel confident in my understanding of them. They seem pretty simple.

3. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

I feel pretty confident. I was not able to get the single line if statement to work on my VS Code, but I can Google it or ask in the future if it's necessary for me to use.

4. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

I thought it would take about an hour, but it took closer to 2 hours. I wanted to do all the challenges available to me so I could learn as much as possible.

5. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I spent a pretty decent amount of time on this assignment, and I feel good about my understanding of conditionals, so at this point I am going to move on to the next one and not worry about extra practice. I'm sure I will learn more and have more opportunities to practice in the future. 

6. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I am just not sure how to write the single line if statement, but I'm sure I can find that on Google pretty quickly. I will probably not look into it until I get the rest of the my assignments done.
